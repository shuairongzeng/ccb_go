# All Plan

Collaborative planning involving selected mounted CLIs with iterative refinement. Codex serves as the primary coordinator.

Highlights:
- Start by selecting participants + arbiter (use `mounted`)
- Clarification is multi-round and participant-driven
- Optional web research for uncertain domains
- Use `ask <provider>` for all participants
- Layered plan output (phases → steps → subtasks)
